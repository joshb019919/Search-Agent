Assignment 1a: Missionaries and Cannibals Problem (DFS & BFS)

DFS:
The DFS algorithm uses a stack to explore nodes (right first since 
popping from end of neighbors), and a set to track visited nodes.  This
finds an optimal path, such as it is.

BFS:
The BFS algorithm uses a queue to explore nodes level by level, and a 
set to track visited nodes.  Proceeds left to right.

The graph is represented as an adjacency list in a dictionary.
The graph structure is as follows:

start   A
      / | \\
     B  C  D
     \\   /
        E
       / \\
      F   G
          |
          H
          |
          I
          |
          J
          |
          K
          |
          L
          |
          M
         / \\
        N   O
        \\ /
goal      P

Output format:

"Node
L: xM yC B(?)
R: xM yC B(?)"

Where x is the number of missionaries, y is the number of cannibals, 
and B indicates the boat's presence on that side.
