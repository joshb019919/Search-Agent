"""Check the admissibility and consistency of two different heuristic
value sets for a 7-node, directed graph.

USAGE:
python admissibility_and_consistency_check.py

AI USAGE:
I used Copilot (chatGPT 4.1) to verify that I properly implemented the
functions to make the checks.

Graph is as follows:

             A
           /   \\ 
         1/     \\4
         /       \\
        B          C
      3/ \\5   2/  \\2
      /   \\   /    \\
     D       E      F
      \\     |      /
       \\    |     /
       6\\   |1   /3
         \\  |   /
          \\ |  /
             G

No directions are depicted (limitation of ascii art), but all lines 
point downward to their nodes.
